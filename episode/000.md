Hello and thank you for listening to the trailer episode of the Seattle Podcasters Podcast. I’m Jason Rigden and I’ll be your host.

On this show I’ll be interviewing other podcasters in the Seattle area. I’ve met so many interesting local folks making shows that I thought interviewing them would make a good podcast. It will introduce listeners to new shows and it will help us podcasters get to know each other.

If you would like to be interviewed on the show, please email me at jason@seattlepodcasters.com

For convenience these interviews will be recorded over the internet. I usually record on Mondays and Tuesdays. The episodes will be released on Saturday mornings and I hope to release a show a week.

So, please subscribe and if you are interested come on the show.

And if you don’t already know, on December 11th at 6pm, the Seattle Podcasters Guild will be having its very first meetup at Optimism Brewing. Come on down and join us.

Thank you for listening and I hope to talk to you again soon. Have a great day.
