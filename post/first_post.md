Welcome to the new Seattle Podcasters Guild site. I hope you like it. I am making this because,I really believe in podcasting. I am a podcast junkie and a serial podcaster.  I want to help connect and develop our local podcast community. I think we can probably learn tons from each other.

The theme has not been publicly released yet. It still needs some work before it can be reusable. The site is being hosted on one of my Linode servers in California. If you have any questions about the site, I would be happy to answer them
